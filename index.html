          Our warehouse is OVERFLOWING with premium NativePath Grass-Fed
          Collagen – take advantage now before this rare opportunity disappears!
        </p>
        <p>
          For a limited time, we're offering our unprecedented "Buy 3 Get 3
          FREE" package to help clear our spring surplus inventory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is this so unusual? Because our premium Type I & III
          collagen—sourced exclusively from pasture-raised cattle—typically
          faces supply shortages due to its exceptional quality and high demand.
        </p>
        <p class="text-bold">But right now, you can:</p>
        <ul class="text-section__list">
          <li>Get 6 jars for the price of 3 (that's 50% OFF!)</li>
          <li>
            Receive a FREE Frother (perfect for your morning collagen coffee)
          </li>
          <li>
            Receive a FREE VIP Coaching Call to help you maximize your collagen
            results ($297 value)
          </li>
          <li>Enjoy FREE Shipping on your entire order</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our longtime customers know that once they start experiencing the
          remarkable improvements in how they look, feel, and move, they never
          want to run out. That's why they're taking advantage of this rare
          surplus to stock up now.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="text-bold"> Why act today?</span> This overstocked
          situation won't last. Once our warehouse returns to normal levels,
          we'll return to our standard pricing—and we may face the usual supply
          constraints that have disappointed customers in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secure your 6-month supply now while our warehouse needs clearing and
          protect yourself from future shortages that leave others waiting.

              Collagen is the most abundant protein in your body, often called
              the "glue" that holds us together.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's a crucial building block for your bones, joints, muscles,
              tendons, and ligaments, as well as your skin, hair and nails.
            </p>
            <p>
              Think of collagen as the framework that gives your body structure
              and support.

        <h3 class="problem__title">The Problem With Collagen</h3>
        <p>
          As we age, our natural collagen production slows down, which can lead
          to wrinkles, joint pain, and weaker bones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Long ago, the human diet consisted of collagen-rich foods – which
          helped offset our decline in collagen production.
        </p>
        <p>Today, however, our modern diets lack collagen.</p>
        <p>
          Therefore our bodies are losing collagen faster than we can replace
          it.
        </p>
        <p class="text-bold">
          Starting around the mid-twenties, our collagen levels can decline by
          1.5% per year.

          The visible and physical signs of aging in your skin, hair, and nails
          and the creaking and popping in your joints may have less to do with
          “getting older”... and more to do with being deficient in collagen.
        </p>
        <p>But here’s the good news with collagen:</p>
        <p class="text-italic">It’s restorable.</p>
        <p>
          Better yet, you won’t have to slow-boil grass-fed bones, marrow,
          cartilage, and organs to do so.
        </p>

          At Last, A Simple, Convenient, Scientifically-Backed Way To Add
          Collagen To Your Diet Every Day In Only Seconds!
        </h3>
        <p>
          Every scoop of NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen is formulated with 10
          grams of the highest-quality grass-fed collagen from happy, healthy
          cattle.
        </p>
        <p>
          It consists of type I and type III fibers, which make up over 90% of
          the collagen in your body. These fiber types are the most important
          for healthy joints, bones, skin, hair, nails, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why you’ll only find collagen types I and III in NativePath
          Grass-Fed Collagen.
        </p>
        <p>
          NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen is also hydrolyzed, meaning it has been
          broken down into small peptides that digest easily and mix well in hot
          or cold beverages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The powder is flavorless and undetectable in coffee, tea, smoothies,
          and more – making it a seamless addition to your everyday routine.

          Replenish Collagen Back To Youthful Levels With NativePath Grass-Fed
          Collagen
        </h3>
        <p>
          By now it’s clear that supplementing with NativePath Grass-Fed
          Collagen provides a convenient workaround for overcoming the
          inevitable age-related decline.
        </p>
        <p>
          And since collagen loss begins around the age of 30, experts strongly
          stress that it’s important to start replacing as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how you supplement is just as important as the quality of the
          collagen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore when it comes to replenishing collagen levels, it is
          important to replace it correctly to get the full benefits. Otherwise,
          it's just a waste of time and money.

          For the past decade, I’ve been providing natural solutions to address
          mobility, joint pain, and bone loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because most of my clients are over 60, their collagen levels are
          already significantly depleted.

        <p>
          Therefore, to compensate for the collagen loss, I recommend an initial
          collagen loading phase to build collagen back up to baseline.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get the most out of collagen supplements, your body needs a good
          base of collagen to start with. Collagen loading provides this base
          for maximum benefits.

          Are you willing to risk spending your so-called “golden years” trapped
          in a downward spiral of age-related decline?
        </p>
        <p>
          Joint pain tends to be the first indication that age-related wear and
          tear is catching up to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          These aches and pains can make it hard to perform simple, everyday
          tasks...
        </p>
        <p>Or engage in your favorite hobbies...</p>
        <p>
          Or worse, your years of independent living without assistance could
          start to slip away.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, many older adults have improved their joint and bone health
          by using the collagen loading technique.
        </p>
        <p>
          And reduce the aches and pains that come along with age-related wear
          and tear...
        </p>
        <p class="text-bold">
          And get their confidence - and their
          <span class="text-italic">life</span> - back...
        </p>
        <p>
          After witnessing firsthand just how powerful collagen supplementation
          can be for people dealing with mobility issues, joint pain, and bone
          loss…
        </p>
        <p>
          I began putting all of my time and resources toward one goal and one
          goal only:
        </p>
        <p>
          To get collagen into as many hands as possible so that it can help
          people restore their bodies and their quality of life...
        </p>
        <p class="text-bold">
          YES, you can take your body and health back into your own hands!

            <p>
              At this point, you may be wondering how you can try NativePath
              Grass-Fed Collagen yourself...
            </p>
            <p>
              Along with how much and how often do you need to take it for best
              results?
            </p>
            <p>At NativePath, our formula contains one single ingredient:</p>
            <p>Hydrolyzed collagen from grass-fed cattle.</p>
            <p>
              This is the richest source of type I and III collagen fibers –
              which make up over 90% of the collagen in our body.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          While other collagen brands use cheaper, multi-collagen types, we only
          use types I and III.
        </p>
        <p>
          This ensures you’re getting the most potent and pure collagen
          supplement on the market for healthy joints, bones, skin, hair, nails,
          and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of our products are as close to nature as possible, which is why
          you will never find any ultra-processed ingredients like artificial
          preservatives, colors, or chemical sweeteners.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there’s just one downside with NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen...
        </p>
        <p>
          Our meticulous manufacturing process and quality assurance can add
          weeks (sometimes months) to our operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means it can take a very long time to produce even a single jar
          of NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of that, those who try NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen keep
          coming back to order more… And at larger quantities, too…

          This is a good problem to have, but the large influx of large orders
          may put even more of a strain on production.
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially since our premium hydrolyzed collagen formula can take
          months to produce.
        </p>
        <p>
          And most of our returning customers purchase our 6-jar package, which
          is the perfect collagen loading supply and our best deal.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, there’s no guarantee of how long our collagen will be in
          stock.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, our sourcing team was able to secure a large surplus of
          our premium collagen formula.
        </p>
        <p>
          With our inventory surplus, we are able to make our collagen more
          affordable than ever before.
        </p>
        <p class="text-bold">
          This is incredible news because I believe collagen should be a daily
          staple in our diet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason is simple: it’s the most important building block for
          healthy joints, bones, skin, hair, nails and more.
        </p>
        <p>Yet, our modern diet lacks collagen.</p>
        <p>
          That’s why I believe everyone should prioritize adding collagen back
          into their diet – especially people over 50 who are collagen
          deficient.
        </p>
        <p class="text-bold">So how much collagen do you really need?</p>
        <p>
          According to research, 10-20 grams of collagen per day can support
          healthy joints, bones, skin, hair, nails, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you know, our bodies have less collagen than they did in our
          twenties.
        </p>
        <p>It's like as we age, our collagen tank starts running low.</p>
        <p>
          For people over 50, I suggest taking more collagen to fill up that
          tank.
        </p>
        <p>This is called collagen loading.</p>
        <p class="text-bold">Instead of one scoop a day, try two scoops.</p>
        <p>
          Taking 2 scoops of collagen daily helps replace what you've lost over
          the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's like giving your body extra building blocks to strengthen itself
          inside and out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Studies show that collagen needs to be taken every day for at least 2
          to 12+ months to see the best results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people find it helpful to continue taking this larger amount for
          a long time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why most people buy 6 jars of NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen at
          once.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to see the full benefits, you need to take collagen every
          day, month after month.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, you need to take collagen every day in order for it to make
          a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking collagen regularly is the best way to help your body stay
          strong and healthy as you age.
        </p>
        <p>Simply put, collagen is no “miracle supplement”...</p>

            choice. Don’t skip days.

            Take at least 1 scoop daily. For best results, take 2 scoops for
            collagen loading.

            Using collagen for more than 3 months can result in impressive joint
            and bone benefits.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-bold">
          In other words, to get the most out of collagen, you need to take
          enough of it every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Collagen works best when you take it regularly without skipping days.
        </p>
        <p>The benefits of collagen compound as weeks and months go by.</p>
        <p>But this only works if you are committed to taking it every day.</p>
        <p>Consistency is key to unlocking the full benefits of collagen.</p>
        <p>Which is why I recommend my clients to:</p>
        <ul class="problem__list">
          <li>
            Start with <span class="text-bold">at least 3 jars</span> of
            NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen at a time.
          </li>
          <li>
            And <span class="text-bold">6 jars</span> if they want to be
            completely safe.
            <span class="text-italic"
              >(This is the package most people purchase.)</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Then take it for a period of
            <span class="text-bold">at least 60-90 days</span> – and don’t skip
            days!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          And there’s never been a better time to secure your supply of
          NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen than now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Studies show that taking collagen for 3 or more months offers the
          greatest benefits, which is why we wanted as many people as possible
          to be able to
          <span class="text-bold"
            >stock up on a large supply at an affordable price.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why my NativePath team and I went to great lengths to secure a
          surplus of grass-fed collagen to provide the best discount we can
          afford to offer.

        <ul class="problem__list">

          Our longtime customers know that once they start experiencing the

          want to run out. That's why they're taking advantage of this rare
          surplus to stock up now.

            There are many collagens out there in the market, for me NativePath
            is the only collagen I will use."

        <div class="faq__question">Q: How many jars should I order?</div>
        <p>
          Our best value and most popular quantity is our "Buy 3 Get 3 FREE"
          package, which offers an unbeatable price of just $31 per jar (retails
          for $37.99 per jar).
        </p>

          That's over $150 in savings and 75 FREE servings of Collagen.
        </p>
        <div class="faq__question">Q.) How many servings are in each jar?</div>
        <p>
          Each full-size jar of NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen contains 25
          servings.
        </p>
        <div class="faq__question">
          Q.) Where does NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen come from?
        </div>
        <p>
          NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen is sourced from pasture-raised cattle in
          South America.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are proud to say that our formula contains only one single
          ingredient: grass-fed collagen.
        </p>
        <p>
          NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen is manufactured in the USA and contains
          zero ultra-processed ingredients. That means no artificial
          preservatives, flavors, dyes, sugar, seed oils, gluten, or GMOs.
        </p>
        <div class="faq__question">
          Q.) How many times per day should I take collagen?
        </div>
        <p>
          Based on feedback from our customers, 10 to 20 grams (or more) of
          collagen per day can provide the greatest age-defying joint, bone,
          skin, hair, and nail benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend taking at least 20 grams (2 scoops) daily for maximum
          results.
        </p>
        <p>
          This might be especially helpful for people over the age of 50, whose
          collagen levels may have already declined by a staggering 50% (or
          more).
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking multiple scoops per day may help restore your collagen deficit
          so that full results can be achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen has no taste or odor, adding
          multiple scoops to your diet has never been easier. Simply add
          NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen to your coffee or tea, smoothie, juice,
          or unsweetened almond milk, or even add it to your yogurt, oatmeal,
          soup, or baked goods.
        </p>
        <div class="faq__question">
          Q.) What is the best way to use this product?
        </div>
        <p>
          The easiest way to use NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen is to mix a
          serving into 8-12 oz of any hot or cold beverage and gently stir.
        </p>
        <div class="faq__question">
          Q.) How long do I have to use this product before I see results?
        </div>
        <p>
          Many of our customers notice results as early as their first week with
          NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, more profound results are reported with regular prolonged
          use. This is why we recommend stocking up with the 6-jar package so
          that you can experience the full benefits of long-term collagen use
          without the risk of running out.
        </p>
        <div class="faq__question">Q.) What is collagen, anyway?</div>
        <p>
          Collagen is the most abundant protein in your body, accounting for
          about a third of its protein composition. It's one of the major
          building blocks of joints, bones, skin, hair, nails, muscles, tendons,
          and ligaments. Collagen is also found in many other body parts,
          including our gut lining, blood vessels, corneas, and teeth.
        </p>
        <div class="faq__question">
          Q.) Why should I add collagen to my diet?
        </div>
        <p>
          While our bodies are fully equipped to produce collagen naturally,
          once we hit our twenties, it begins to decline by 1-1.5% per year.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, one study looked at type I collagen in the skin of old
          individuals versus young folks and found that collagen synthesis was
          decreased by 68% in old skin versus young skin*.

        </div>
        <p>
          If you’ve ever wondered why our skin begins to sag and wrinkle as we
          get older – it’s likely that low collagen levels are behind it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is because as you age, your body produces less collagen. The
          effects, such as achy joints, bone loss, wrinkled skin, and brittle
          nails, may become noticeable after several years.

          any age.
